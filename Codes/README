This directory contains R scripts and Java codes used to generate the figures and data reported in the work entitled 

"Predicted CoronaViruses Self-Interactome Completeness Correlates Inversely with their Transmissibility" by Gabriel Del Rio.

For the R scripts, you need to have installed R (follow instructions from the developers web site: https://www.r-project.org) in your computer.

It is also advisable to install R studio (follow instructions from the provider: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

After installing R, the following packages need to be installed:

1) ggplot2 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)

2) reshape (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape/index.html)

3) grid (https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/grid/)

4) lattice (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html)

5) gridExtra (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/index.html)

Please verify the versions available for your operating system.

For the codes written in Java, the java compiler and java virtual machine are needed. 

These come in a JDK bundle for different operating systems at: https://www.oracle.com/mx/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html.

All the codes were tested in Java version 8 and they should work for that version and above. 

For compiling any Java file (files with extension .java), type in your console:

javac <java_file>

where <java_file> is the name of a java file.

After executing the command, a new file should be created in the directory where you executed the javac command with the same name as <java_file>, but with .class extension.

You may execute the java code typing at your console:

java <java_file_without_extension>
