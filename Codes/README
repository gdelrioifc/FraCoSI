This directory contains R scripts and Java codes used to generate the figures and data reported in the work entitled 

"Predicted CoronaViruses Self-Interactome Completeness Correlates Inversely with their Transmissibility" by Gabriel Del Rio.

For the R scripts, you need to have installed R (follow instructions from the developers web site: https://www.r-project.org) in your computer.

It is also advisable to install R studio (follow instructions from the provider: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

After installing R, the following packages need to be installed:

1) ggplot2 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)

2) reshape (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape/index.html)

3) grid (https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/grid/)

4) lattice (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html)

5) gridExtra (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/index.html)

Please verify the versions available for your operating system.



For the scripts to execute Weka, you need to have installed the java virtual machine and the Weka application. Follow the instructions from the providers. 

Java comes in a JDK bundle for different operating systems at: https://www.oracle.com/mx/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html.

All the codes were tested in Java version 8 and they should work for that version and above. 


Weka is avaiable at https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ and is available for the most commonoperating systems that support Java.
