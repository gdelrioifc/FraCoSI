This directory contains R scripts and Java codes used to generate the figures and data reported in the work entitled 

"Predicted CoronaViruses Self-Interactome Completeness Correlates Inversely with their Transmissibility" by Gabriel Del Rio.

For the R scripts, you need to have installed R (follow instructions from the developers web site: https://www.r-project.org) in your computer.

It is also advisable to install R studio (follow instructions from the provider: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

After installing R, the following packages need to be installed:

1) ggplot2 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)

2) reshape (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape/index.html)

3) grid (https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/grid/)

4) lattice (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html)

5) gridExtra (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/index.html)

Please verify the versions available for your operating system.



For the scripts to execute Weka, you need to have installed the java virtual machine and the Weka application. Follow the instructions from the providers. 

Java comes in a JDK bundle for different operating systems at: https://www.oracle.com/mx/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html.

All the codes were tested in Java version 8 and they should work for that version and above. 


Weka is avaiable at https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ and is available for the most commonoperating systems that support Java. You need to set your classpath to include the jar files required to execute Weka and Auto-Weka.

We include here the algorithms used to predict PPI for every viral protein included in this study. Here is the name of the files followed by a brief description.

Algorithm File Name           Description
LatD6Concat.model             This algorithm is aimed to be used with ARFF files with extension "LatD6Concat.arff"

LatD6Sum.model                This algorithm is aimed to be used with ARFF files with extension "LatD6Sum.arff"

LatD7Concat1.model            This algorithm is aimed to be used with ARFF files with extension "LatD7Concat1.arff"

LatD7Concat2.model            This algorithm is aimed to be used with ARFF files with extension "LatD7Concat2.arff"

LatD7Concat3.model            This algorithm is aimed to be used with ARFF files with extension "LatD7Concat3.arff"

NoLatD8Concat.model           This algorithm is aimed to be used with ARFF files with extension "NoLatD8Concat.arff"


An example on how to use any of these models to generate a set of statisitical parameters is provided below:

java -Xmx20G weka.classifiers.meta.AutoWEKAClassifier -T [path to arff file] -l [path to model] -toggle "TP rate, FP rate,Precision,Recall,F-measure,MCC,ROC area,PRC area"

If you want to get the list of PPIs, you use this command:

java -Xmx20G weka.classifiers.meta.AutoWEKAClassifier -T [arff file] -l [model] -p 0

For this to execute properly, you need to set the classpath to include the weka and auto-weka jar files. Note that the ARFF files are provided in the DataSets directory.

The flag -Xmx20G specifies the maximum amount of RAM that the JVM will use to execute the command. This is only provided as an example; you may want to test with different values depending on your computer.
